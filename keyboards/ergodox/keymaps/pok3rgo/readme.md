# Pok3rgoDox Layout

[This layout](http://configure.ergodox-ez.com/keyboard_layouts/qlooxw/edit) was created to leverage familiarity with the default Pok3r layout during the transition to ErgoDox. Similarities between this keymap and the Pok3r include:

- `IJKL` direction keys on layer 1
- `SDF` media volume keys on layer 1
- `Fn1` mapping to the CAPS location (optional on the Pok3r)

Because of the relative compression of the right half of the keyboard, some punctuation from the upper rows was relocated in order to maintain availability of those symbols in the default layer. Key differences between this layout and the Pok3r include:

- `SPACE` and `ENTER` on the right thumb cluster
- `` and `=` on the left thumb cluster
- space cadet `SHIFT` for ease of parenthetical statements
- `BRACKETS` and `BRACES` to the bottom row on each side

Some other differences:

- `ESC` is in the upper right of the left keyboard
- `BACKTICK` is in the upper left of the left keyboard
- there is no bottom row `Fn1` key
- `SLEEP/WAKE` on the right thumb cluster
- `PRTSC` and `CAPS` on the left thumb cluster
- `PGUP`, `PGDN`, `HOME`, and `END` on the thumb clusters
