# Pok3rgoDox Layout

I created [this layout](http://configure.ergodox-ez.com/keyboard_layouts/qlooxw/edit) to leverage my familiarity with the default Pok3r to enhance the transition to the ErgoDox. Similarities between this keymap and the default layout of the Pok3r include:

- IJKL direction keys on layer 1
- SDF media volume keys on layer 1
- Fn mapping to the CAPS location (optional on the Pok3r)

Because of the relative compression of the right half of the keyboard, some punctuation from the upper rows was relocated in order to maintain availability of those symbols in the default layer. Key differences between this layout and the Pok3r include:

- SPACE and ENTER on the right thumb cluster
- - and = on the left thumb cluster
- space cadet SHIFT for ease of parenthetical statements
- BRACKETS and BRACES to the bottom row on each side

Some other differences:

- ESC is in the upper right of the left keyboard
- ` is in the upper left of the left keyboard
- there is no bottom row Fn1 key
- SLEEP/WAKE on the right thumb cluster
- PRTSC and CAPS on the left thumb cluster
- PGUP, PGDN, HOME, and END on the thumb clusters
